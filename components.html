    <h1>The biggest heading h1</h1>
    <h2>The second biggest heading h2</h2>
    <p>This is normal text. Long running text would look like this on your website. This will auto fold based on the width

    <h2>@containers</h2>
    <h3>@fluid container</h3>
    <div class="container-fluid">This is going to be a fluid container. It will go full width of page. With some margin.</div>

    <h3>@center container</h3>
    <div class="container-center">The thing to remember with center container is that margin: 0 auto shows it's effect on div in view when div has max width otherwise the div is expanded to whole page so it is already in center so therefore you were not able to see it's effect.</div>
